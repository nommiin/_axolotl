!! These notes might be outdated or just plain bad. I'll occassionally update them every now and then.

~~ Program Initiation
(128,128,128) = Cartridge Background
(0,0,0) = Program Start
(255,255,255) = Program End

~~ Stack Manipulation
(255,200,16) = Push String (Following this is the string length, ad the strings.)

~~ Functions
(128,64,128) = Print

~~ Notes
All strings have a Red and Green value of 99, the Blue value is the ASCII character.
Example: (99,99,65) would be 'A'

Integers have a Red and Green value of 255, the Blue value is the number
Example: (255,255,64) would be '64'
