# _axolotl
_axolotl is an esoteric programming language that is made of in-line coloured pixels programmed in GameMaker: Studio.

#Why?
No reason really, if I had to give one I guess it'd be boredom. This isn't meant to be a real program, I'm just doing this for reaserch and learning purposes. A lot of features you might see in other programming languages are missing.
