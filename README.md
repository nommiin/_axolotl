# _axolotl
_axolotl is an esoteric programming language that is made of in-line coloured pixels programmed in GameMaker: Studio.

# Why?
No reason really, if I had to give one I guess it'd be boredom. This isn't meant to be a real programming "language", I'm just doing this for reaserch and learning purposes. A lot of features you might see in other programming languages are missing.

# Features
Summary:
You can push strings to the stack (maximum length of 255) and then print them out... that's it for now.

Current:
- The ability to push strings to the program's stack.
- The ability to print the string inside of the stack.
- The ability to save a .png file of the cartridge.

Planned:
- Actual programming logic (if statements, variables, adding values)
- Looping
- Functions
- Drawing Graphics
- Playing Audio
- Make a compiler that isn't horrible

Dreams:
- An example game made in _axolotl
- A calculator made in _axolotl
- Lua to _axolotl
- GML to _axolotl
